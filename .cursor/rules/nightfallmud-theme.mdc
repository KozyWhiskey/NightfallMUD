# NightfallMUD Theme & UI Design Principles

## World & Mood
- The world of Vesper is in eternal twilight after the Nightfall, with the Gloom as a core threat. The tone is desperate, dark fantasy: oppressive, cold, and dangerous.

## Global Theme ([client/src/theme.ts](mdc:client/src/theme.ts))
- **Background:** Deep, cold vignette using a radial gradient from #18181b to #111112 for an oppressive, twilight feel. This is enforced globally via Chakra's `globalCss`.
- **Text:** Muted light gray (`gray.100`) for readability in the gloom.
- **Gloom Accent:** `#3a4a4a` is the core "Gloom" color, used for map, borders, and accents.
- **Danger/Combat:** Deep, bloody reds (`danger.700`, `danger.500`) for threat and combat.
- **Highlight:** Pale, ghostly blue (`pale.200`) for rare/important or "last light" elements.
- **Gold:** For rare/important items or UI highlights.
- **Fonts:** Gothic serif (`Merriweather, Georgia, serif`) for headings, modern sans-serif for body.
- **Gray Palette:** Tuned for cold, desaturated, and moody UI elements.
- **Theme tokens are available for use in any Chakra UI component.**
- **All Chakra UI panels and components must use these tokens and design principles.**
- **All new UI should be reviewed for mood and palette consistency.**

## Map Panel ([client/src/components/MapPanel.tsx](mdc:client/src/components/MapPanel.tsx))
- **Default rooms:** Deep gray (`#23232a`), low contrast.
- **Adjacent rooms:** The "Gloom" color (`#3a4a4a`), muted and cold.
- **Current room:** Pale, ghostly blue (`#b6e0fe`) with a faint, slow pulse and soft glowâ€”never neon.
- **Combat:** Deep, bloody red (`#7f1d1d`) with a subtle, slow pulse and shadow.
- **Lines:** Blue-gray, low opacity for a misty, faded look.
- **Up/Down indicators:** Dimmed blue, low opacity.
- **SVG background:** Radial gradient for a subtle vignette, adding to the oppressive feel.
- **Pulse and glow effects are implemented in the SVG for current/combat rooms.**

## UI/UX Principles
- No bright or neon colors; all highlights are muted, cold, or ghostly.
- Panels, modals, and all UI elements should feel like they belong in a world of eternal twilight and creeping despair.
- Use semantic tokens for "gloom," "danger," and "pale" highlights.
- Favor subtle glows, pulses, and shadows over strong contrast.
- All design choices should reinforce the sense of a world fighting against oblivion and the encroaching Gloom.
- **All new UI and features must be checked for theme and mood consistency.**
