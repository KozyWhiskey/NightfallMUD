## 1. Overview

This task involves refactoring the Map tab in the client to provide a more modern and intuitive user experience. The new design will feature a grid-based map that displays the player's current room and the surrounding rooms, making it easier for players to navigate the game world.

## 2. Rationale

The current map implementation is basic and lacks the visual clarity and interactivity of modern game maps. By refactoring the map to a grid-based system, we can provide players with a more immersive and user-friendly way to explore the world.

## 3. Architectural Impact

- **Components:**
    - A new `MapGrid` component will be created to render the grid-based map.
    - The existing `MapPanel` component will be updated to use the new `MapGrid` component.
- **Data Flow:**
    - The `useGameStore` will be updated to store and manage the player's current location and the surrounding room data.
    - The `MapPanel` will fetch this data from the store and pass it to the `MapGrid` component.
- **State Management:**
    - The `useGameStore` will have a new state property to hold the map data.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Create `MapGrid` Component:**
    - Create a new file `client/src/components/MapGrid.tsx`.
    - This component will take a 2D array of room data as a prop.
    - It will render the rooms in a grid layout.
    - The player's current room will be highlighted.
2.  **Update `MapPanel` Component:**
    - Modify `client/src/components/MapPanel.tsx`.
    - Fetch the map data from the `useGameStore`.
    - Pass the map data to the `MapGrid` component.
3.  **Update `useGameStore`:**
    - Modify `client/src/stores/useGameStore.ts`.
    - Add a new state property for the map data.
    - Implement a function to update the map data when the player moves.
4.  **Styling:**
    - Create a new CSS file `client/src/components/MapGrid.css`.
    - Style the `MapGrid` component to be visually appealing.
    - Use CSS to highlight the player's current room.

## 5. Key Files to Modify

- `client/src/components/MapPanel.tsx`
- `client/src/components/MapGrid.tsx` (new file)
- `client/src/components/MapGrid.css` (new file)
- `client/src/stores/useGameStore.ts`

## 6. Potential Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk:** The grid-based map may be difficult to implement and may have performance issues.
    - **Mitigation:** We will start with a simple implementation and optimize it as needed. We will also test the map on a variety of devices to ensure it performs well.

## 7. Testing Strategy

- [ ] **Unit Tests:**
    - Create unit tests for the `MapGrid` component to ensure that it renders correctly.
- [ ] **Integration Tests:**
    - Create integration tests to ensure that the `MapPanel` and `MapGrid` components work together correctly.
- [ ] **Manual Testing Checklist:**
    - Manually test the map to ensure that it is working as expected.
    - Verify that the player's current room is highlighted correctly.
    - Verify that the map updates when the player moves.

## 8. Rollback Plan

In case of failure, the changes will be reverted by deleting the new files and reverting the changes to the modified files.

## Notes & Decisions

- The map will display a 3x3 grid of rooms, with the player's current room in the center.
- The rooms will be represented by simple squares with the room name displayed inside.
- The player's current room will be highlighted with a different color.
